<p>I needed a way to chronicle and showcase a growing list of projects for 25x52. Based on some quick research, Jekyll seemed like a good solution especially since my projects are hosted on Github. </p>

<p>Except I didn’t know Jekyll. </p>

<p>And all the Jekyll templates I found were either ugly or ill-suited since they were mostly intended to be blog clones. </p>

<p>So, out of necessity, I needed to make my own. And you’re looking at it. </p>

<p>Feel free to use it for your own project documentation. Fork it here: <a href="https://github.com/femmebot/jekyll-grid">https://github.com/femmebot/jekyll-grid</a></p>

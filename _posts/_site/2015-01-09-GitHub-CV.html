<p>This is a simple AJAX script that dynamically generates a portfolio page of your public GitHub repositories.</p>

<p>There’s a saying that “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve waited too long.” Well, this is the first version, and it’s a bit embarrassing.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/femmebot/GitHub-Project-CV">dig into the script</a>. I would love to hear feedback on how to make improvements.</p>

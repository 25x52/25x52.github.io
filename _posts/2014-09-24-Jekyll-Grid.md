I needed a way to chronicle and showcase a growing list of projects. Since my projects are hosted in Github, Jekyll seemed like the right solution. Except I didn&rsquo;t know Jekyll. And all the Jekyll templates I found were either ugly or inadequate since they were mostly designed to be blog clones. Out of necessity, I fashioned a Jekyll template to help solve a need for displaying Github projects. Fork it here: [https://github.com/femmebot/jekyll-grid](https://github.com/femmebot/jekyll-grid)

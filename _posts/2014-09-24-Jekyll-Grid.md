I needed a way to chronicle and showcase a growing list of projects for 25x52. Based on some quick research, Jekyll seemed like a good solution especially since my projects are hosted on Github. Except I didn&rsquo;t know Jekyll. And all the Jekyll templates I found were either ugly or inadequate since they were mostly designed to be blog clones. 

Out of necessity, I fashioned a Jekyll theme&mdash;the very same one you&rsquo;re looking at now&mdash;to document my projects. Feel free to use it for your own project documentation. Fork it here: [https://github.com/femmebot/jekyll-grid](https://github.com/femmebot/jekyll-grid)
